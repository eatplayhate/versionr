Grapevine Support
=================

Unfortunately, I don't have the time to personally respond to every support request I receive for the open source software I publish. [sadface] Fortunately, I haven't received very many such requests - fortunate because that means Grapevine is easy to understand and intuitive to use! If you do find yourself in need of some support, here are several free options, and one not-so-free option.

### [Refer To The Documentation](https://github.com/scottoffen/Grapevine/wiki) ###

**For 3.1.x**

In addition to class level documentation, the [project wiki](https://github.com/scottoffen/Grapevine/wiki) also provides several *Getting Started* tutorials to help you understand how the pieces fit together, and contain some very basic examples. This should be the starting point for anyone new to Grapevine.

**For 4.x**

See the [new project website](https://sukona.github.io/Grapevine/), hosted by github.io!

### [Ask The Community For Help](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/grapevine?sort=newest) ###

I'm on the [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) Q&A boards regularly, as are several other individuals with experience using Grapevine - and an even broader community of people with experience using [C#](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/c%23) and [REST](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rest) who generously take their time to respond to the question and problems of complete strangers without asking for anything in return. Use the [#grapevine](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/grapevine?sort=newest) hashtag to post your question there - don't forget code examples - and someone (who am I kidding? probably me) would be happy to help you find your way forward.

### [Report An Issue](https://github.com/scottoffen/Grapevine/issues) ###

Did you find a defect with Grapevine? Man, that's gotta be embarrassing for me, right? Do me (and everyone else) a huge favor and use the [Issues feature](https://github.com/scottoffen/Grapevine/issues) on GitHub to let me know what you found and how to reproduce it. One of the many great advantages to this approach is that you can follow the progress of the issue over time. Remember, the more detail you can provide, the faster I can provide an update with a fix or another solution.

>**IMPORTANT:** Please use this option only for code related issues, not usage support requests.

### [Share Your Enhancements](https://github.com/scottoffen/Grapevine/graphs/contributors) ###

Grapevine is open source, and quite a few people that have found Grapevine useful have also generously given back to the community by [sharing the enhancements](https://github.com/scottoffen/Grapevine/graphs/contributors) they have made. Great contributions, everyone, thanks! If you've made an improvement to Grapevine that you'd like to share with the rest of the community, create a pull requests and our team of enthusiasts (yeah, still just me) will take a look and maybe even pull them into a future release.

If you have a great idea for an enhancement, but don't know how to implement it, create an issue and tag it as an *enhancement*, and maybe someone else will pick it up and add it for you.

Whether you're contributing code or just an idea, providing a clear and detailed use case and usage examples is going to be paramount in deciding if and when your contribution makes it into the core library.

Depending on our availability, sometimes pull requests will sit in the queue until we can get around to reviewing them and merging them into the master branch. I appreciate your patience with my time as I endeavor to ensure that Grapevine remains a stable, high-quality and reliable solution.

### Geek For Hire ###

> Let me be **very clear** about this: I did not create Grapevine and offer it as open source with the intention of making money off of it, nor am I making this suggestion in an *ex post facto* attempt to monetize. Not that I'd turn down the opportunity to benefit from my hard work here, but I'd be just fine if this option were never exercised. That being said...

**If you'd like to pay** for my time and expenses to:

- Provide consulting services on your project
- Train your team on REST and/or Grapevine
- Give higher priority to your support requests

Then you should [contact me directly](mailto:github@scottoffen.com) with your request, project time-frame and a description of the problem you'd like me to solve, and I'll respond to you with my availability and an estimate on a first-come-first-serve basis.
